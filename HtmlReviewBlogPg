        <h1>HTML Foundations review</h1>

        <h2>What is html?</h2>

        <p>"Hyper Text Markup Language" or HTML is the backbone of web development.
            however it is a scripting language rather than a programming language.
        </p>
        
        <quote>A script is a sequence of instructions that is interpreted 
            by a program rather than  by the computer processor.</quote>
        
        <h2>HTML Syntax</h2>

        <p>HTML syntax works through the use of "<>" to indicate the beginning of an element and "</>" to indicate the ending, these are known as opening and closing tags.</p>

        <!--nesting, when an element is nested within another it is called a child element.
        For instance the body element is the parent element the h1, h2 and p elements are child elements,
        and if there were elements within the child elements they would be grandchild elements. However,
        the wording changes. When referring to the grandchild we address it as the main element, and the 
        child element becomes the parent element and so forth.-->
